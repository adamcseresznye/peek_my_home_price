This step is imperative as it enables us to assess the effectiveness of various feature engineering approaches without risking overfitting our model. A robust cross-validation strategy ensures that our model's performance evaluations are reliable and that the insights gained are generalizable to new data. To accomplish this, we will employ `RepeatedKFold` validation, setting the parameters with n_splits as 10 and n_repeats as 1.\r\n",
